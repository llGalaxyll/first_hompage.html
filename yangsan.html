        Yangsan City (Culture Language: Liangshan City) is a city located in eastern South Gyeongsang Province in South Korea. The eastern part is the mountainous terrain of Busan Metropolitan City, Kijang-gun and Yeongchuksan Mountain, and the western part is located near Gimhae City by the border of Nakdong River, the southern part of Geumjeongsan Mountain bordering Busan Metropolitan City, Geumjeong-gu and Bukgu, and the northern part of Ulsan City and Miryang City. Although it forms the Yeongdam City Area due to the division of functions with Busan and Ulsan, it is now taking on an independent form of the city by expanding the urban infrastructure and amenities such as transportation, education and culture, with the focus of the Mulgeum Site Development Zone currently under construction.[1] South Gyeongsang Province has the third largest population after Changwon and Gimhae. The city hall is located in Nambu-dong, and the administrative district is located in 8 p.m. on 4 p.m. and 1 p.m.
